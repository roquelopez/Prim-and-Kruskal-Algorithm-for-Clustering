Prim and Kruskal Algorithm for Clustering
=========================================
Implementations in Java of Prim's algorithm with Binary Heap data structure and Kruskal's algorithm with Union-Find data structure to calculate the minimum-spanning-tree  for clustering.

Execute the Main.java file and use the data.txt file for testing.

The clustering_result.png shows the output of the program.
